![alt Sparks](../Images/Sparks1.png)

Nicholas Sparks was born on 31st of December 1965 in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.

Sparks grew up mainly in north-central California, where his family moved when he was eight. He attended the University of Notre Dame on a track scholarship, but an injury ended his budding athletic career and induced him to write his first (unpublished) novel.

He graduated in 1988 with a major in business and held a variety of jobs, including pharmaceutical salesman.

In the early 1990s he and his wife settled in New Bern, North Carolina, which later provided a setting for his novels.

Although Sparks’s fiction usually involved love stories, he rejected the suggestion that he was a “romance novelist.” His supporters agreed that although romance played a role in his works, Sparks explored more-serious subject matter, such as loneliness, grief, obsession, and loss, and that many of his books featured poignant, less-than-happy endings.

Sparks, a devout Roman Catholic, devoted much of his time and literary profits to writing programs at Notre Dame and to charitable causes.

Sparks lives in North Carolina. He contributes to a variety of local and national charities. He is a major contributor to the Creative Writing Program (MFA) at the University of Notre Dame, where he provides scholarships, internships, and a fellowship annually. He co-founded The Epiphany School in New Bern, North Carolina in 2006. He also spent four years coaching track and field athletes at the local public high school. In 2009, the team he coached at New Bern High School set a World Junior Indoor Record in the 4×400 meters, as well as US High School National Records in the 800 Medley and 1600 Medley.
