## A Walk to Remember

![alt book](../Images/walk-to-remember.jpeg)

Every April, as the sea breeze carries the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter reminisces about his final year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already experienced a few relationships. He even believed he had been in love before. However, the last person he expected to fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. Jamie, a quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her, seemed content living a life separate from the other teens. She cared for her widowed father, rescued injured animals, and volunteered at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out, and Landon never would have imagined doing so. Then, by twist of fate, Jamie became his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon's life changed forever. Being with Jamie would reveal to him the depths of human emotion and lead him to a decision so profound it would set him on the path to adulthood.
